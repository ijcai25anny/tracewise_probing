You are given a problem and a solution (which may contain buggy code). Your task is to output the fixed code and a unit test to demonstrate the correctness of your fix.

Your test cases should be written using pytest, be self-contained, and each test case's function name should start with test_. These test cases should use the pytest framework and utilize the unittest.mock.patch decorator to mock interactions with hardware, system operations, file paths, disk storage, or third-party libraries. However, interactions with Python's internal standard library should remain unmocked for direct execution. Ensure the test cases are efficient and precise in verifying the code's required behavior.

#### Constraints:

* Do not include explanations, reasoning, or usage examples in the revised code.

* Ensure the revised code is self-contained, function/class-based, and free of top-level code.

* If test case functions (e.g., test_xxxxx) are mistakenly mixed into the code section, move them to the test cases section without breaking functionality.
>> For example:

```python
def test_corner_case_xxxx():
    ...

def test_corner_case_yyyy():
    ...

```
Group correlated test cases together and separate repetitive cases into multiple test cases.
